	Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximum-element/problem
	Language : C++
	Tool Version : Visual Studio Community 2017
	Thoughts :
	
	1. Let the maximum element present in stack be max. Initialize max to 0.
	2. Start a loop to process next queries:
		2.1 Next query push: 
			- Let the new element be e. 
			- If e > max then set max = e. 
			- Push e to top of the stack. 
			- Increment top of stack by 1.
		2.2 Next query Delete:
			- If element at top of stack is not same as max then remove the element from top of stack and decrement top of stack by 1.
			- If element at top of stack is same as max then
				- Remove the element from top of stack and decrement top of stack by 1.
				- Set max to 0.
				- Scan the remaining stack and set max to the highest element present in remaining stack.
		2.3 Next query print:
			- Print the element at the top of the stack.
	Time Complexity:  Push operation - O(1), Delete operation - O(n), Print Operation - O(1)
	Space Complexity: Push operation - O(1), Delete operation - O(1), Print Operation - O(1) //number of dynamically allocated variables remain constant for any input.
