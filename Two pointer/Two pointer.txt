Two pointers is really an easy and effective technique which is typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array.
Given a sorted array A (sorted in ascending order), having N integers, find if there exists any pair of elements (A[i], A[j]) such that their sum is equal to X.

two pointer is to find two values in array so that there sum is equal to given x

 4 5 6 7 8 9
we have to find two values that are equal to x = 17

Bruteforce = we have to compare everyelements with others element untill the ans
            but time complexity is 0 n^2

two pointer method = time complex = 0n
