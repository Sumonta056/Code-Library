In number theory, Wilson's theorem states that a natural number n > 1 is a prime number if and only if

// * ((n-1)!)  mod  n = (n-1)

That is, it asserts that the factorial (n - 1)! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ...............*(n - 1) is one less than a multiple of n exactly when n is a prime number.

for example :

for n= 4
(n-1) ! = 6
(n-1) ! mod n =2

for n= 5
(n-1) ! = 24
(n-1) ! mod n = 4

for n=6
(n-1) != 120
(n-1) ! mod n =0

for n=11
(n-1) ! = 3628800
(n-1) ! mod n = 10

for n =12
(n-1)! = 39916800
(n-1) ! mod n = 0
