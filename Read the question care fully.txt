You are given a sequence s of n characters (, ), and/or ?. There is exactly one character ( and exactly one character ) in this sequence.

You have to replace every character ? with either ) or ( (different characters ? can be replaced with different brackets).
 You cannot reorder the characters, remove them, insert other characters, and each ? must be replaced.

so i stuck at this coner case ()))
but i didnot notice that in question is given --- There is exactly one character ( and exactly one character ) in this sequence.

that means there will not be such case because  in (  ) situation ther will always be e ? 
the case will be (?))
this type

quesition should care fully
